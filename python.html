					<h3>Python basics</h3>
					<p>
					Python, developed by Guido van Rossum, is not only a free software but also a powerful modern computer programming language. Python is a high-level but easy-to-learn interactive, interpreted, and object-oriented scripting language. Python is highly readable since the English keywords are frequently used instead of punctuations used by other languages, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.
					</p>
					<p>
					There are some similarities between Python and Fortran, one of the earliest programming languages, but Python is much more powerful than Fortran. Python uses variables without declaring them and uses indentations as a control structure. Unlike Java, programmers don’t have to define classes in Python but are free to do so when necessary.
					</p>
					<p>
					In addition, Python is also a major tool for web development.
					</p>
					<h3>Data analysis</h3>
					<p>
					Python has grown and got dedicated open source libraries substantially from the community over the last several years for data analysis and predictive modeling through its evolution from originally a general purpose language. This includes the fundamental packages and libraries for scientific computing, data analysis and statistical applications such as NumPy, IPython, matplotlib, and pandas etc.
					</p>
					<h3>Data visualization</h3>
					<p>
					What’s called good data means the data that one can easily visualize and understand. In data science, generating the most comprehensive and understandable visualizations is highly desirable. Datasets and their sources vary in types including remote data, local data, JSON, CSV etc as well as the data from relational databases. However, the process is not always simple since one has to find the data, process them by reading, cleaning and massaging, and then use the right tool to visualize them.  
					</p>
					<p>
					Basic simple plots could easily be created in Python using matplotlib, however, the more advanced charting for the most appealing visualizations requires, and can only be accomplished with the knowledge and skills of Python in combination with other tools.
					</p>
					<h3>Machine learning and artificial intelligence</h3>
					<p>
					Python is known for its simplicity and thus considered to be an ideal language for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). The library, Pybrain, is especially rising for machine learning in Python.

						<h3>What we do</h3>
						<p>This is somewhat an introduction on using Python for computational genomics. It is aimed at wet-lab researchers who wants to use Python in their data analysis, and bioinformaticians who are new to Python and wants to learn more about its capabilities for genomics data analysis. As new high-throughout experimental techniques on the rise, data analysis capabilities are sought-after features for researchers. R, with its statistical heritage, plotting features and rich user-contributed packages is one of the best languages for the task of analyzing data.
