					<h3>Big data concept</h3>
					<p>
						<em>"Big data is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation." -- Gartner (2012)</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Accordingly, big data have three defining properties/dimensions including <b>(1) volume</b> (quantity), <b>(2) variety</b> (types: structured, semi-structured and unstructured) and <b>(3) velocity</b> (streaming data with speed). The variety of big data implies any of the following types:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Structured data:</b> RDBMS data, easily retrieved through SQL.</li>
							<li><b>Semin-structured data:</b> data in files (xml, json docs, NoSQL database).</li>
							<li><b>Unstructured data:</b> images, videos, text files etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Python libraries and packages for big data analysis</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Data wrangling: pandas</b> (data analysis).</li>

					<h1 class="page-title">Machine Learning</h1>
					<h3>What is machine learning?</h3>
					<p> The term "machine learning" was originally given by Arthur Samuel in 1959, which is "a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to 'learn' with data, without being explicitly programmed". Arthur Samuel is considered a pioneer of AI and computer gaming from IBM in the United States.
					</p>
	 
					<h3>Machine learning algorithms</h3>
					<p>The machine learning algorithms can be divided into three categories: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement algorithms. (1) Supervised algorithms: it requires the input and an expected output for the data. The variables from the model are adjusted during the testing process so that the output closes to the expected value/goals. (2) Unsupervised algorithms: it has input but there is no particular outcome expected from the testing phase. The algorithms may cluster the data sets together for different outcomes. (3) Reinforcement algorithms: it trains the algorithms for improvement after each decision, based on its output (success or failure).
					<ul>
						<li><b>Decision tree:</b> Decision tree algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning where the data continuously get split based on specific parameter, i.e. an output is generated based on the input from the training data. The tree is formed with two entities, namely the decision nodes (where the data is split) and the leaves (the decisions).  In other words, it classifies a set of existing data into different groups according certain attributes, perform a test at each node, through branch judgement, and continuously split the data into additional distinct groups. The tests are made on the existing data, and when new data come in they can be classified to the corresponding groups.<br><br>
						There are two main types of Decision Trees including (1) Classification trees (Yes/No types): The decision variable is categorical; (2) Regression trees (continuous data types): The decision or the outcome variable is continuous such as an actual number. The two common decision tree algorithms include Random Forests (it builds different classifiers using a random subset of attributes and combines them for output) and Boosting Trees (it trains a cascade of trees one on top of others by correcting the mistakes of ones below them).
						</li><br>
						<li><b>Linear regression:</b> Linear regression is used to predict the value of an outcome variable (Y) based on one or more input predictor variables (X). Its objective is to develop a model that the dependent variable (Y) is expressed as a mathematical function of one or more independent variables (X), so that we can use the regression model to predict Y if X is known. The mathematical function can be expressed below (such as simple linear regression with one independent variable):<br>
						<br>
						<span lang="latex">Y=\beta _{1} + \beta _{2}X + \varepsilon</span><br>
						<br>
						where, <span lang="latex">\beta _{1}</span> is the intercept and <span lang="latex">\beta _{2}</span> is the slope, which  are both called <em>regression coefficients</em>. <em>ϵ</em> is the error term for the portion of Y where the regression model cannot explain.<br>
						<br>
						The <em>t-statistic</em> (<span lang="latex">\beta -coefficient/Std.Error</span>) is used to test the significance of the individual regression coefficients while the <em>F-statistic</em> (<span lang="latex">MS_{R}/MS_{E}</span>) is for the test of goodness of fit for the regression model, where:<br>
						<span lang="latex">MS_{R}=\sum_{i}^{n}(\hat{y}_{i}-\bar{y})/(q-1)=(SS_{T}-SS_{E})/(q-1)</span><br>
						<span lang="latex">MS_{E}=SS_{E}/(n-q)</span> and <span lang="latex">MS_{T}=SS_{T}/(n-1)</span>, while <br>
						<span lang="latex">SS_{E}=\sum_{i}^{n}(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i})^{2}, </span> <span lang="latex">SS_{T}=\sum_{i}^{n}(y_{i}-\bar{y_{i}})^{2}</span><br>
						where, <em>n</em> is the number of observations, <em>q</em> is the number of coefficients, <span lang="latex">\hat{y}_{i}</span> is the fitted value for observation <em>i</em> and <span lang="latex">\bar{y}</span> is the mean of Y.<br>
						<br>
						<span lang="latex">R^{2}</span> and <span lang="latex">R^{2}_{adj}</span>:  <span lang="latex">R^{2}</span> measures the proportion of variation in the dependent (response) variable that is explained by the model. As more independent variables X are included to the new model, they would add to the total variation that was already explained, regardless of their significance levels, which would cause a greater <span lang="latex">R^{2}</span> value. Thus, the new <span lang="latex">R^{2}</span> value for the new model needs to be adjusted, namely <span lang="latex">R^{2}_{adj}</span>:<br>
						<br>
						<span lang="latex">R^{2}=1-SS_{E}/SS_{T}</span> and <span lang="latex">R_{adj}^{2}=1-MS_{E}/MS_{T}</span>, which have the following relationship:<br>
						<span lang="latex">R_{adj}^{2}=1-\frac{(1-R^{2})(n-1)}{n-q}</span>
						</li><br>
						<li><b>Logistic regression:</b> Logistic regression was developed by the statistician David Cox in 1958 and is one of the popular machine learning algorithms for binary classification. It measures the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables by estimating the probabilities using its underlying logistic function which is also called the sigmoid function as shown below:<br>
						<br>
						<span lang="latex">y=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}</span><br>
						<br>
						The probabilities are then transformed into binary values to make a prediction based on the logistic function. It aims to maximize the likelihood that a random data point is classified correctly into one of the two possible outcomes or dichotomy using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.<br>
						<br>
						</li>
						<li><b>Naive Bayes:</b> It is a simple but powerful classification technique for predictive modeling based on Bayes’ Theorem assuming the independence among predictors or independent variables. The model may include two types of probabilities which may be obtained from the training data: (1) The probability for each class; (2) The conditional probability for each class given a value for each of the independent variables. The probability model is used for making predictions for new data using Bayes Theorem.</li>

					<h1 class="page-title">Deep Learning</h1>
					<h3>What is deep learning?</h3>
					<p>Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning using artificial or deep neural networks to train the computer to perform human-like tasks such as image and speech recognition. Deep learning is currently at the cutting edge of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) which has led to the breakthroughs such as audio processing, computer vision as well as self-driving cars, etc.
					</p>
					<p>Most of the deep learning methods use neural network architectures, thus the deep learning models are usually considered as deep neural networks where “deep” relates to the number of hidden layers in the neural network and the Networks may have tens or hundreds of hidden layers.
					</p>		
	 
					<h3>Packages for deep learning</h3>
					<p>Python has a number of deep learning libraries and listed below are the most useful libraries that support different deep learning architectures such as auto-encoders, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and feed-forward networks etc..
					<ul>
						<li><b>Theano:</b> is a low-level and major foundational library with tight integration with NumPy for fast and efficient numerical computation that can be run on the CPU or GPU architectures.</li>
						<li><b>TensorFlow:</b> is a low-level library less mature than Theano for fast numerical computing which is supported by Google for out-of-the-box distributed computing. It is a foundation library for creating Deep Learning models directly or by using wrapper libraries that simplify the process built on top of TensorFlow.</li>
						<li><b>Keras:</b> is a heavyweight wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Keras is a high-level neural networks API and is modular for rapid experimentation.</li>
						<li><b>Lasagne:</b> is a lightweight wrapper for Theano for building and training neural networks, which provides the flexibility of Theano and the neural network layers to be used.</li>
						<li><b>MXNet:</b> is a high-level library similar to Keras. The framework provides bindings for multiple languages and support for distributed computing that is designed for efficiency, flexibility and the productivity.</li>
