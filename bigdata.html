					<h3>Big data concept</h3>
					<p>
						<em>"Big data is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation." -- Gartner (2012)</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Accordingly, big data have three defining properties/dimensions including <b>(1) volume</b> (quantity), <b>(2) variety</b> (types: structured, semi-structured and unstructured) and <b>(3) velocity</b> (streaming data with speed). The variety of big data implies any of the following types:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Structured data:</b> RDBMS data, easily retrieved through SQL.</li>
							<li><b>Semin-structured data:</b> data in files (xml, json docs, NoSQL database).</li>
							<li><b>Unstructured data:</b> images, videos, text files etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h1 class="page-title">Big Data Analytics</h1>
					<h3>Data processing and analytics</h3>
					<p>Data processing and analytics include building and training machine learning models, manipulating data with technology, extracting information from data as well as building data tools, applications, and services. It may consist of the following major steps:
					<ul>
						<li>Framing the problem</li>
						<li>Data acquisition for the problem</li>
						<li>Data wrangling</li>
						<li>Machine learning</li>
						<li>Developing a statistical/mathematical model</li>
						<li>Data visualization</li>
						<li>Communicating the output of the analysis: (1) data report, and (2) data products.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Python libraries and packages for big data analysis</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Data wrangling: pandas</b> (data analysis).</li>
						<li><b>Data exploring: matplotlib</b> (graphics computing).</li>
						<li><b>Developing model: scikit-learn</b> (machine learning: data mining & analysis), <b>NumPy</b> (scientific computing).</li>
						<li><b>Visualization: Bokeh</b> (interactive visualization library for browsers), <b>SciPy</b> (science, math & engineering).</li>
					</ul>


					<h3>The outcomes from big data analysis</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Descriptive:</b> to generate descriptive details from the big data.</li>
						<li><b>Predictive:</b> to create a model from the big data and predict likely outcomes.</li>
						<li><b>Prescriptive:</b> to recommend corresponding actions based on the exiting information.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>

					<h1 class="page-title">Machine Learning</h1>
					<h3>What is machine learning?</h3>
					<p> The term "machine learning" was originally given by Arthur Samuel in 1959, which is "a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to 'learn' with data, without being explicitly programmed". Arthur Samuel is considered a pioneer of the computer gaming and artificial intelligence at IBM of the United States.
					</p>
	 
					<h3>Machine learning algorithms</h3>
					<p>ML algorithms are those that can learn from data and improve from experience, without human intervention. Learning tasks may include learning the function that maps the input to the output, learning the hidden structure in unlabeled data; or ‘instance-based learning’, where a class label is produced for a new instance by comparing the new instance (row) to instances from the training data, which were stored in memory. ‘Instance-based learning’ does not create an abstraction from specific instances.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Decision tree:</b>Classify a set of data into different groups using certain attributes, execute a test at each node, through brach judgement, further split the data into two distinct groups, so on and so forth. Tests are done based on existing data, and when new data are being added it can be classified to the corresponding group.</li>
						<li><b>linear regression:</b></li>
					</ul>
					</p>	
			
					<h1 class="page-title">Deep Learning</h1>
					<h3>What is deep learning?</h3>
					<p>Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning using artificial or deep neural networks to train the computer to perform human-like tasks such as image and speech recognition. Deep learning is currently at the cutting edge of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) which has led to the breakthroughs such as audio processing, computer vision as well as self-driving cars, etc.
					</p>
					<p>Most of the deep learning methods use neural network architectures, thus the deep learning models are usually considered as deep neural networks where “deep” relates to the number of hidden layers in the neural network and the Networks may have tens or hundreds of hidden layers.
					</p>		
	 
					<h3>Packages for deep learning</h3>
					<p>Python has a number of deep learning libraries and listed below are the most useful libraries that support different deep learning architectures such as auto-encoders, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and feed-forward networks etc..
					<ul>
						<li><b>Theano:</b> is a low-level and major foundational library with tight integration with NumPy for fast and efficient numerical computation that can be run on the CPU or GPU architectures.</li>
						<li><b>TensorFlow:</b> is a low-level library less mature than Theano for fast numerical computing which is supported by Google for out-of-the-box distributed computing. It is a foundation library for creating Deep Learning models directly or by using wrapper libraries that simplify the process built on top of TensorFlow.</li>
						<li><b>Keras:</b> is a heavyweight wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Keras is a high-level neural networks API and is modular for rapid experimentation.</li>
						<li><b>Lasagne:</b> is a lightweight wrapper for Theano for building and training neural networks, which provides the flexibility of Theano and the neural network layers to be used.</li>
						<li><b>MXNet:</b> is a high-level library similar to Keras. The framework provides bindings for multiple languages and support for distributed computing that is designed for efficiency, flexibility and the productivity.</li>
					</ul>

						<h3>What we do</h3>
						<p>This is somewhat an introduction on <em>big data</em> basics and the analytics. The increasing amount of genome sequencing data from various biological species can be a type of big data in terms of computational genomics and data analysis. It is aimed at wet-lab researchers who want to understand big data concept and the analyses and bioinformaticians who are new to <em>big data</em> and want to learn it.</p>
