					<p>
					R is a free (libre) programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. 
					</p>
					<p>
					This is somewhat an introduction on using R for computational genomics. It is aimed at wet-lab researchers who wants to use R in their data analysis ,and bioinformaticians who are new to R and wants to learn more about its capabilities for genomics data analysis. As new high-throughout experimental techniques on the rise, data analysis capabilities are sought-after features for researchers. R, with its statistical heritage, plotting features and rich user-contributed packages is one of the best languages for the task of analyzing data.
					</p>
					<p>
					R has become more and more important software language for carrying out both simple and complicated statistical analyses, including:
					</p>
					<ul>
							<li>Data summary and exploration</li>
							<li>Graphical presentation</li>
							<li>Data modelling</li> 
					</ul>
					<p>
					Unlike other statistical softwares, R stores information and operates on objects, such as scalars, vectors, matrices, lists and dataframes etc. It is very useful to define new types of object to target particular applications.  One of R's essential features is that it will do different things for different types of objects.
