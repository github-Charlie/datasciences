Use the following [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/github-Charlie/myworld/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for the website in Markdown files.

Whenever a commit is made to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content of the Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling the writing. It includes conventions for general HTML-like codes.
For more details, just visit [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

The Github Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme that I have selected in the [repository settings](https://github.com/github-Charlie/myworld/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Note:

```
* Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for writing for the web.
* Markdown is not a replacement for HTML, or even close to it. Its syntax is very small, corresponding only to a very small subset of HTML tags. The idea is not to create a syntax that makes it easier to insert HTML tags. In my opinion, HTML tags are already easy to insert. The idea for Markdown is to make it easy to read, write, and edit prose. HTML is a publishing format; Markdown is a writing format. Thus, Markdown’s formatting syntax only addresses issues that can be conveyed in plain text.
* For any markup that is not covered by Markdown’s syntax, you simply use HTML itself.
