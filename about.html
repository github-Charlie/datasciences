					<strong>The initial experience in programming</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
					While pursuing his graduate studies for the Master’s Degree in Statistical and Quantitative Genetics at <a href="http://english.njau.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nanjing Agricultural University</a>, the author had the opportunity to take the programming courses, i.e. Fortran and BASIC. Later, he used the genetic algorithm of the languages to build genetic models for data analysis and prediction of various parameters for the quantitatively inherited traits of soybean for his M.S. project/thesis using an early Apple Computer (IIc) many years ago (see the picture). 
					</p>
					<p>
					By the way, Fortran (formerly FORTRAN from “FORmula TRANslation”) is a general-purpose programming language which is well suited to numeric computation & scientific computing. It was developed in the early 1950s by the team led by John W. Backus at IBM and later released in 1957. However, it's a compiled language compared with other interpreted languages such as Python and JavaScript. BASIC (“Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code”) is a general-purpose and high-level programming language which was designed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, USA in 1964.

					<strong>Computer simulation</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
					One of his earlier experience was the computer simulation of the distributions of the phenotypic data which was influenced by both genetic and environmental factors as part of the research proposal for my PhD project at the <a href="https://www.usask.ca/" target="_blank">University of Saskatchewan</a>. The phenotypic data, due to the genetic models and the modes of gene actions, depended predominantly on the number of genes as well as the environmental factors varied by the locations and years for the resistance to the common bunt disease of wheat using <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html/" target="_blank">SAS</a> and <a href="http://www.minitab.com/en-us/" target="_blank">MINITAB</a> packages. The initial intention was to explore the possibility of grouping or clustering the simulated datasets of continuous distributions or compound probability distributions. Looking back the simulation with the concept of <em>machine learning (unsupervised learning)</em> in mind, the objective of my simulation was to draw inferences for genotypic groups from the datasets simulated with the genetic models of different assumptions through the cluster analyses such as k-means, mixture models and hierarchical clustering.
